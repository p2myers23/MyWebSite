            Shaun White was born on September 3, 1986. As a professional snowboarder, he was earned three Olympic gold medals. He also holds the record for the most gold medals for both the X-Games and the Olympics as a snowboarder. White received his first sponsor at age seven and was quickly recognized by many professional skateboarders. Tony Hawk was one, and he noticed Shaun White skateboarding when he was only nine. Tony Hawk mentored him until he was 17. He is most recognized for his multiple medals in the and summer and winter X-Games and the Winter Olympics.

            When I was 12 years old, I saw Shaun White compete in the 2018 Winter Olympics and receive his 3rd gold medal. After watching the game, I researched and watched a movie about Shaun White. I quickly became attatched to skiing and later picked up skateboarding. Throughout the past years, I have been trying to learn new tricks on skis (rotations, grabs, rail, etc.) by watching multiple X-Games and Olympic skiers. Although Shaun White is a snowboarder and I ski, he inspired me by neer giving up and always wanting to excel.
