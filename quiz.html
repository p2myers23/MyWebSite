1. create the questions and answers lists
2. use document.getElementById to change the value of the question text box to a question
3. Increase index by 1 every time the button is clicked
4. refresh the index once it is higher than the amount of questions
5. for each question collect what the user puts into the answer text box
6. check to see if the user's answer is correct
7. if the user's answer is correct add 1 to score
